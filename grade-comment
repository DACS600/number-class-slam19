1 – Nice user interface.  But I would have preferred you use printf.

2- Lots of extras and interesting mathematical tests and operations you tried and implemented nicely.  Very well done.

3 – You isPrime method is rather long and does a lot of unnecessary checks.

4 – You should not have unitialized variables.

In all a great job that shows thorough understanding with lots of extras.
